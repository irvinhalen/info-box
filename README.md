# Info-Box

Welcome to Info-Box! This is the result of a mini test that uses React and TypeScript.

## Description

I approached this test by first a simple styling of the UI to help me grasp what I am dealing with because I like to imagine what I am doing if I can see where the information will end up. Afterwards, I made the component with the props that it (including their types) and then simply passed the information to that component.
